# Algorithm Project with Student Dashboard

This project combines **sorting algorithms** (Quick, Merge, and Radix sort) with an interactive **Student Dashboard** built using Streamlit to manage and visualize student data.

---

## 📌 Project Structure

- `student_dashboard.py`: Streamlit web app for data input, sorting, and visualization.
- `sorting_algorithms.py`: Contains implementations for Quick, Merge, and Radix sorting algorithms.
- `README.md`: Documentation and report.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice and demonstrate multiple sorting algorithms.
- Provide a web interface to input, sort, and visualize student data.
- Combine algorithmic logic with modern UI for better understanding.

## 📚 Sorting Algorithms

This project includes Python implementations of:

- **Quick Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Radix Sort**

The sorting algorithms are used to order student data by grade, name, or performance.

---

## ✅ Features Covered

- Input student data (name, grade, performance).
- Apply different sorting methods.
- Show results in tables and charts.
- Visualize grade distributions and performance stats.

---

## ✅ Technologies

- Python
- Streamlit
- Plotly
- SQLite (or CSV for storing data)
