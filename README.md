# Student Dashboard - Description and Report

## Overview
The **Student Dashboard** is a web application built using the Streamlit framework. It provides an interactive platform for managing and visualizing student data, including names, grades, and performance levels. The application is designed with a modern dark theme and includes various features for data input, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Features

### 1. **Dark Theme and Styling**
- A custom dark theme is applied using CSS for a visually appealing interface.
- Buttons, tables, and other components are styled for better usability.

### 2. **Header and Footer**
- A header image is included to make the app more engaging.
- A footer with branding and copyright information is added for professionalism.

### 3. **Data Input**
- Users can input student details (name, grade, and performance) through text fields.
- A "Submit" button allows users to save the data into a database.

### 4. **Data Display**
- A "Display Data" button fetches and displays all student records in a sorted table (sorted by performance and grade).
- The table is interactive and styled for readability.

### 5. **Statistics**
- The app calculates and displays key statistics for grades:
  - **Mean**: Average grade.
  - **Median**: Middle value of sorted grades.
  - **Mode**: Most frequently occurring grade.
- These statistics are displayed using Streamlit's `metric` component.

### 6. **Visualizations**
- **Histogram**: A histogram of student grades is created using Plotly, with a dark theme and custom colors.
- **Pie Chart**: A pie chart visualizes the distribution of performance levels among students.

### 7. **Individual Sorting**
- Users can sort data by name, grade, or performance using a radio button.
- Sorted data is displayed in tables, and bar charts are generated for each sorting option.

## Technical Highlights

### 1. **Streamlit Framework**
- The app is built using Streamlit, a Python framework for creating interactive web applications.
- It leverages Streamlit's components like `text_input`, `button`, `dataframe`, `radio`, and `metric`.

### 2. **Database Integration**
- The app interacts with a database through the `Student` class, which handles data insertion and retrieval.

### 3. **Plotly for Visualizations**
- Plotly is used to create interactive and visually appealing charts (histogram and pie chart).

### 4. **CSS for Custom Styling**
- Custom CSS is injected using `st.markdown` to apply a dark theme and improve the app's appearance.

## Strengths
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app is intuitive and easy to use, with clear input fields and buttons.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: The use of Plotly charts enhances data exploration and understanding.
- **Modern Design**: The dark theme and custom styling make the app visually appealing.
- **Comprehensive Features**: The app combines data management, statistics, and visualization in one platform.

## Suggestions for Further Improvements
1. **Error Handling**:
   - Add error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric grades).
   - Handle database connection errors gracefully.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cache database queries using `st.cache_data` to improve performance for large datasets.

3. **Export Options**:
   - Allow users to export the displayed data (e.g., as a CSV file).

4. **Authentication**:
   - Add user authentication to restrict access to sensitive data.

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**:
   - Optimize the layout for better usability on mobile devices.

## Conclusion
The "Student Dashboard" is a well-designed and feature-rich application for managing and visualizing student data. It effectively combines functionality, aesthetics, and interactivity, making it a valuable tool for educators and administrators. With minor enhancements, it can become even more robust and user-friendly.
